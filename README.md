# ImageGatherer

Jupyter notebook to collect and save images for a specific query. 

# Setup

1. Install Python 3.x (I used [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) ) on your machine
2. Install the following libraries (if not already included)
    - json
    - urllib.request
    - requests
3. Open the Python notebook called [ImageGatherer.ipynb](Image_Gatherer/ImageGatherer.ipynb) with the command: 

```terminal
jupyter notebook ImageGatherer.ipynb
```

You can leave out the file name to get to the folder if you want to duplicate, rename or delete notebooks. You can start them also from this view.

4. Read through the instructions in the notebooks to get the notebook functional. You have to get a key for the [Bing Image Search](https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services/en-us/bing-image-search-api)
